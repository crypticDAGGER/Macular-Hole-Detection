macula_data/negative has a lot of shitty images, filter out the good ones, at least 85

Make a cropping mechanism for easily cropping out the maculas (OpenCV)

Resize all excrated macula into a uniform (128*128)

Data augmentation(*) -- rotation, invert, shear

Do some basic preprocessing -- Normalising, CLAHE, Noise Reductions

Split into train, val, test

Feature extracts -- HOG,SIFT,LBP

Build the classifiers using sklearn -- 
	SVM - Gaussian, Linear or Quadratic kernel
	Boosted Random Forest
	1 Layer Softmax
